# Swedish recycling custom component
This custom component checks the recycling station (Ã¥tervinningsstation). Check https://www.ftiab.se/173.html to search for your specifc recycling station. You will need the unique id of the station when configuring the component. Please advice that the component uses undocumented scraping API:s that can change at any time and used at your own risk. **The author takes no liability of usage**. I urge to Ask FTI AB permission before use.

# Usage

## Copy and paste
The component can be used by copy everything under `custom_component` folder to your `custom_component`, i.e. the `swedish_recycling` folder.

### Configure trough integrations (prefered way)
Check under configuration/integrations. Add the `Swedish recycling service (ftiab.se)` integration.

### Configure with old school yaml
You can setup through configuration.yaml:

```yaml
